Research experience
======
* Statistics Research Assistant — Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University                     
Jan 2023 — Present (2 year)   						Blacksburg, Virginia 
      
  * First research on neural network models to predict failure status and remaining life of GPU   
      	Supervised by Dr. Yili Hong 
                                                                                
   *	Utilized PyTorch to develop models predicting failure status and the remaining life of GPUs
   *	Conducted comparative analysis of neural networks against traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K - nearest Neighbor, Gradient Boosting)
  
  * Second research on incorporating random effects on neural network models 
     *	Incorporate random effect in Deep Neural Network models to predict failure status and remaining life of GPU using Pytorch
     *	Implemented embedding layers to incorporate random effects into neural network architecture
     *	Integrated complex spatial structures characterized by the physical and logical distances of GPU units to model random effects


* Statistics Research Assistant — Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University                     
May 2021 — Aug 2022 (1 year)                                                                            Blacksburg, Virginia
  *	Performed Statistical Analysis for the paper Risks and Outcomes of New Onset of Unmet Need for Mobility and Self-care Daily Activities
  *	Fitted Generalized Linear Mixed model based on NHATS (National health and Aging Trend Study) using SAS

* Statistics Research Assistant — Miami University                                                      Oxford, Ohio                             May 2019 — Aug 2020 (1 year)     
  *	Analyzed the impact of the Gaussian kernel bandwidth parameter on the performance of the One-Class Peeling (OCP) method based on simulation
  *	Explored a two-stage OCP method, leveraging support vector data description and Gaussian kernels to iteratively estimate dataset centers by peeling flexible boundaries
  *	Executed parallel simulations using the parallel package in R
